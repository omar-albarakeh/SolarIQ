### SOLARIQ is built using the following technologies:

- Flutter: [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/).A powerful app development framework used to build a dynamic, responsive, and visually appealing mobile application with seamless cross-platform performance.
- Node.js with NestJS: [NestJS - A progressive Node.js framework](https://nestjs.com/) A progressive Node.js framework employed to develop a robust and scalable backend architecture, ensuring efficient API management, secure data handling, and well-structured business logic.
- React: [React Library](https://react.dev/)A flexible and efficient JavaScript library utilized to create a modern, interactive, and user-friendly web interface for enhanced user engagement.
- MongoDB: [Mongo Database](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) A NoSQL database chosen for its scalability and flexibility, enabling efficient storage and management of solar energy data, user preferences, and real-time updates.
- OpenWeather API:[Weather provider](https://openweathermap.org/api) For providing weather-based energy forecasts to optimize solar energy usage.
- Gemini AI:[Gemini AI](https://ai.google/discover/)  The core engine powering the AI solar advisor, delivering personalized energy insights, recommendations, and actionable strategies for maximizing solar efficiency.
- Arduino:[Arduino](https://docs.arduino.cc/)  is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a microcontroller that can be programmed to read inputs (e.g., sensor data) and control outputs (e.g., actuators, LEDs, motors). In the context of a solar energy system, Arduino can be used to collect real-time data from sensors (e.g., solar panel voltage, current, temperature) and control devices (e.g., relays, inverters).
- ESP8266:[ESP8266](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a low-cost Wi-Fi module with a full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability. It enables Arduino (or other microcontrollers) to connect to the internet, making it a key component for IoT applications. In this system, the ESP8266 acts as the bridge between the Arduino hardware and the web-based backend or frontend, allowing data to be transmitted over Wi-Fi for real-time monitoring and control.
- WebSockets:[WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex, real-time communication between a client (e.g., a web or mobile app) and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, WebSockets maintain a persistent connection, enabling instant data exchange without the need for repeated polling. In this setup, WebSockets facilitate seamless communication between the Arduino-ESP8266 hardware and the backend/frontend systems, ensuring real-time updates (e.g., sensor data, weather conditions) and control commands (e.g., adjusting solar panel angles, turning devices on/off)

### IoT project
In my IoT project, I integrated an ESP8266 microcontroller to serve as the communication bridge between various components, leveraging the concept of WebSocket for real-time, bidirectional data exchange. A potentiometer was utilized to simulate the behavior of a solar panel, capturing wattage. I could control the flow of watts by adjusting the potentiometer, and this data was transmitted to my **SolarIQ** Flutter application instantly. Additionally, the project included a bidirectional communication setup, enabling my Flutter app to send control signals to a servo motor. The servo motor, equipped with an ultrasonic sensor, functioned as a radar system to detect and measure distances dynamically. By utilizing WebSocket technology, this project ensured seamless, low-latency communication between hardware and software, enabling efficient real-time monitoring and control to emulate a smart solar energy system.
